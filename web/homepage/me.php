		<h1>Who Am I</h1>
		<h2>Brief History</h2>
		<p>I was born in Hawaii, lived a couple of years in Virginia, but mostly raised in Utah. There I went to three elementary schools, two middle schools, and one high school. I graduated from Alta High in 2012 with a class of about a thousand. I went on a mission to California as one of the first 18 year old missionaries. I went to LDSBC for a year, then SLCC for a semester, then came to BYUI. I started as a business management major, then accoutning, then computer science, then software engineering. I hope to graduate this semester.</p><br>
		<h2>Interests</h2>
		<p>I like games, and I play a number of them. I'm pretty big into Magic the Gathering. I frequently go to large tournaments with money on the line. I play League of Legends if I'm looking to just hang out with friends. I play Osu! as a challenging rythm game that rewards improvment.</p>
